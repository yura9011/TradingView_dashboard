# VSA Scenarios: Old vs New Logic
> What changed? Concrete examples of the "Smart Money" upgrade.

## 1. The "Fakeout" (Breakout Trap)
**Scenario**: Price breaks resistance with a wide green candle, but closes off the highs (wick on top) with Ultra High Volume.

| System | Signal | Interpretation | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **OLD (Basic TA)** | ✅ **BULLISH** | "Strong Breakout! Price is making new highs. Momentum is strong." | **BUY** (Get Trapped) |
| **NEW (VSA)** | ❌ **BEARISH (Upthrust)** | "Trap detected! High volume but price failed to close high. Professionals are selling into the herd's buying." | **SELL/WAIT** (Avoid Trap) |

## 2. The "Hidden Strength" (The Test)
**Scenario**: Price drops back to a support level on very LOW volume.

| System | Signal | Interpretation | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **OLD (Basic TA)** | ⚠️ **NEUTRAL/WEAK** | "Price is falling. Momentum is bearish. Wait for a green candle." | **WAIT** (Miss Entry) |
| **NEW (VSA)** | ✅ **BULLISH (Test)** | "Successful Test! Price fell but no one is selling (Low Volume). Supply is exhausted." | **BUY EARLY** (Sniper Entry) |

## 3. The "Weak Rally" (No Demand)
**Scenario**: Market is in a downtrend, then rallies up with narrow green candles and DECREASING volume.

| System | Signal | Interpretation | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **OLD (Basic TA)** | ❓ **POSSIBLE REVERSAL** | "Green candles appearing. RSI moving up from oversold. Looks like a recovery." | **BUY** (Catch Falling Knife) |
| **NEW (VSA)** | ❌ **BEARISH (No Demand)** | "Weak Rally. Price moving up but volume is vanishing. Professionals are not interested. Market will fall." | **SHORT** (Ride Trend) |

## Summary of Differences
1.  **Metric**: Old used **Price** only. New uses **Volume + Spread**.
2.  **Psychology**: Old followed the **Herd** (breakouts). New tracks the **Professionals** (liquidity, traps).
3.  **Risk**: New system aggressively vets "fakeouts" using RVOL (Relative Volume), preventing bad trades that look good on the surface.
